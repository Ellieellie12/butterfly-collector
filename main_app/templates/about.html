  <h1>All About Being A Buttefly Collector</h1>
  <hr />
    <p class="page-content">
      The best part of collecting butterflies is being able to let them back out into the wild after I study them. When I'm out catching them time stops. Overall this has been such a life changing hobby of mine and I hope for you it becomes something you hold dear to your heart.
